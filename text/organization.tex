The presented report starts with relevant theoretical concepts necessary to understand the project \textbf{(Section 2)}. It follows two section describing the main tools required, the \textbf{EL Framework (Section 3)} and the \textbf{DBT (Section 4)}. Since the project was developed under the \textbf{Waterfall model}, the projects progress flows through the phases of: \textbf{Requirements Analysis and Definition (Section 5)}, where the definitions, expectations and needs are determined to achieve the main goals of the project; \textbf{System and Software Design (Section 6)}, where the system is designed to satisfy the specified requirements and software solutions are exploited; \textbf{Implementation and Unit Testing (Section 7)}, where the solutions are implemented and granularly tested; \textbf{Integration and System Testing (Section 8)} where all the implementations are merged and global tests are made.
Finally, it follows a \textbf{conclusion} of all work done and \textbf{future perspectives} \textbf{(Section 9)}.
