The project constraints can be classified in two types: \textbf{Technical Constraints} and \textbf{Non-Technical Constrains}. The first ones are related with the technical parts of the project and the second are associated with management issues. Both kinds represent limitations to the developing of the project and so the problems resulting therefrom must be overcome.

\subsubsection{Technical}
\begin{itemize}
\item The DBT must be modeled using the DSL created in embedded system's course and the final project must be generated using the developed framework. 
\item The models can only be implemented after the development of the framework has been finished.
\item The project will be developed around an already implemented Dynamic Binary Translator, that has as its source the 8051 architecture and target the Thumb2 ISA (ARM Cortex-M3).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Technical}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project only has a duration of one semester.
\item The UC has only 5 ECTS (8h/week).
\item The group is composed by two elements.
\end{itemize}
