The first is represented in the figure \ref{fig:TCache_Hw} and probably less efficient is to create two AXI peripherals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Translation Cache - Implemented AXI LITE peripheral;
	\item Dual Port RAM - Includes a BRAM Controller and a Block Memory Generator, both provided by Xilinx.	
\end{itemize}

For this implementation, the \textit{TCache} peripheral instantiate a CAM Module in order to find if the actual BB is or isn't translated and to return the address in the RAM where is the translation;
